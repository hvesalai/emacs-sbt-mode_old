The mode provides basic functionality required for successfully
interacting with [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) inside emacs. The
core functionality includes:

- interacting with sbt shell and scala console
- compiling code and navigating to errors

See also (emacs-scala-mode)[https://github.com/hvesalai/emacs-scala-mode].

## Installation

The preferred mechanism is via MELPA and `use-package` as per our
[Learning Emacs](/editors/emacs/learning) guide:

```elisp
(use-package sbt-mode
  :commands sbt-start sbt-command
  :config
  ;; WORKAROUND: allows using SPACE when in the minibuffer
  (substitute-key-definition
   'minibuffer-complete-word
   'self-insert-command
   minibuffer-local-completion-map))
```

Start an sbt session with `M-x sbt-start` or send a command to the current sbt process with `M-x sbt-command`.

You might also want to customize some `sbt-mode` variables (run `M-x customize-mode RET sbt-mode`).

For example you can play with variable
`sbt:scroll-to-bottom-on-output`. If set to `t` (which is a default
value) sbt output buffer scrolls automatically to the last line if
there is some new output. Setting this variable to `nil` will cause
point remain on it's current position in a buffer when there is some
new output. If set to `nil` and point is on the last line, it scrolls
automaticaly with new output, but if there is compilation error (line
beginning `[error] - ...`) it will stop on that line.

## sbt 1.0

Although sbt 1.0 is supported, there are some niggles. Pull requests
are always welcome to enhance the mode.

## Related Customizations

To work efficiently with `sbt-mode`, you may wish to customise your
workflow with the built-in Emacs compile support:

- customise `compilation-skip-threshold`
- locally bind a key to `comint-bol`
- locally bind a key to `comint-accumulate`
- locally bind a key to `next-error`

A more daring customisation is to use `prettify-symbols-mode` to
replace long repetitive strings with symbols. For example

```elisp
(add-hook 'sbt-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (setq prettify-symbols-alist
                  `((,(expand-file-name (directory-file-name default-directory)) . ?âŒ‚)
                    (,(expand-file-name "~") . ?~)))
            (prettify-symbols-mode t)))
```

will replace occurrences of the project's root directory with the
UTF-8 symbol for "house" and any long-form occurrences of your home
directory with tilde.

## Tasks

### Searching

Most users may prefer to use
[projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) for these
features, but `sbt-mode` provides also `grep`-based commands for
searching things.

A special version of the `rgrep` command is available with `sbt-mode`.

- `M-x sbt-grep` greps files in the sbt project
- `M-x sbt-find-definitions` will search for the definition of the
  thing at point from the project `.scala` and `.java` files.
- `M-x sbt-find-usages` will search for occurrences of the id at point
  from the project `.scala` and `.java` files.

### Scala console

It is also possible to drop into an sbt `console` session using `sbt-mode`.

It is advised when typing multi-line code snippets, use
`comint-accumulate` instead of `RET` for newlines. This way, if you
need to modify the code, you can use `M-p` to recall the whole snippet
for reworking.

You can also send a region of code from an other buffer in the same
project. First set the mark to the other end of the region to send and
the point (cursor) the other. Then run the `M-x sbt-send-region`
command. `sbt-paste-region` will enter `:paste` mode of Scala REPL, so
that multiline statement/expression will work as expected.

### Compiling

The simplest way to compile the code you are working on in emacs by
binding the `sbt-run-previous-command` to a key. For example
`(local-set-key (kbd "C-x '") 'sbt-run-previous-command)`. By default,
this will run `test:compile` (see `sbt:default-command` customization
variable).

### Triggered execution

Triggered execution in sbt, the `~compile` or `~test` commands (when
sbt is waiting with the message "press enter to interrupt"), can be
interrupted by typing `C-c C-j` in `sbt-mode` (and `C-c C-b C-j`
anywhere else). Hitting just `RET` in an sbt buffer doesn't interrupt
sbt because there isn't a recognized sbt prompt in `sbt-mode`.
Instead, hitting `RET` in an `sbt-mode` buffer will cause Emacs to
complain that "Text is read-only".

## Hydra

`sbt-mode` also offers [hydra](https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra) to
speed up sbt interaction. This is focused mainly on running usual sbt
commands `compile`, `test:compile`, `test`, `run` etc. on multiproject
build. Hydra allows to execute these commands on per project basis.

### Basics

Run the `M-x sbt-hydra` command. This will start new sbt process in
sbt buffer (if there is already sbt process running it will switch to
it's buffer).

You will see message:
```
Please wait! sbt projects are loading. sbt Hydra will be ready soon.
```
while sbt is launching.

To generate hydra we need to get information about available projects.
This is done by running `projects` command in sbt (this is done
automatically as soon as sbt is ready). After this is done, you will
see message:

```
Success hydra for projects (projectA, projectB, ...) created.
```

After you will see this message run `M-x sbt-hydra` command again and
you will see hydra appearing at the bottom of the screen. By pressing
`h` you can invoke help where you can learn more detais about Hydra
features.

We recommend to bind `sbt-hydra` command to some convenient shortcut.

### Recommended usage

Hydra remembers last command which was executed and it can run this
command automatically again on a save of an edited file. Of course it
would be undesirable to run 10 commands when saving 10 edited files by
`save-some-buffers` command so for this reason last sbt command will
be run again only on a save of last edited file.

To enable this feature add `sbt-hydra:check-modified-buffers` into
`before-save-hook`. For example:

```elisp
(add-hook 'sbt-mode-hook (lambda ()
                           (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'sbt-hydra:check-modified-buffers)))
```

To eliminate undesirable execution of last sbt command, there is
customizable variable `allowed-files-regexp` containing regular
expressions to detect files which when edited will cause executing
last sbt command again. By default this variable contains two records:
`.*.scala$` and `^routes$`.


### Customization

There exists 3 [Directory Local
Variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html)
which provides more customization for Hydra. They must be specified in
`.dir-locals.el` file in the root of your sbt project.

#### 1. sbt-hydra:projects

This variable allows to specify list of projects to include in the
Hydra. By default Hydra includes all sbt projects, which in case there
is lots of them make working with Hydra cumbersome. This variable,
when set, allows to specify subset of all projects.

```elisp
((sbt-mode
  (sbt-hydra:projects "api" "core" "foo" "jerky" "server" "swanky" "util")))
```

#### 2. sbt-hydra:command-line-arguments

When using `run` sbt command we usually want to provide some command
line arguments to the main method. This variable allows us to specify
these arguments. We can provide different arguments for every
projects. Example configuration looks like this:

```elisp
((sbt-mode
  (sbt-hydra:command-line-arguments . (
    ("restApi" . "myconf.conf development")
    ("jobs" . "delivery_flag")
    ("identityManager" . "myconf.conf 9001")))))
```

Here we have 3 sbt projects `restApi`, `jobs` and `identityManager`.
For example when we execute `run` command through `r` hydra key we
provide `myconf.conf development` arguments to `restApi` project main
method.

#### 3. sbt-hydra:system-properties

When using `run` sbt command we may to set system variables for our
program to use while running. This variable allows us to specify
system variables without need to manipule environment variables. When
set they will be provided to our main method by forking JVM and
putting them into `javaOptions` before executing `run` itself.

```elisp
((sbt-mode
  (sbt-hydra:system-properties . (
    ("macwire" . ("-Dconf.file=myconf.conf" "-Xmx1G"))
    ("reader" . ("-Dconf.file=myconf.conf" "-Xmx1G"))))))
```

Here we have 2 sbt projects `macwire` and `reader`. For example for
`macwire` project there will be set two system variables
`-Dconf.file=myconf.conf` and `-Xmx1G`.
